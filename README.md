# Node.js Project - Basic CRUD

This is a basic Node.js project to practice creating CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). It uses `express` for the server, `nodemon` for automatic restart during development, and is managed with `yarn`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v23.7 or higher)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (v1.22.22 or higher)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project folder:

    ```bash
    cd your-project
    ```

3.  Install the dependencies

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

    _or you can use_

    ```bash
     npm install
    ```

    then you go with:

    ```bash
    yarn add eslint prettier eslint-plugin-prettier eslint-config-prettier -d
    ```

4.  Running the Project
    To run the project in development mode, use the command:

    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

    > This will start the server using nodemon, which will automatically restart the server whenever you make changes to the code.
